# Demo Project

This is a demo project demostrating my coding style. All the rights are deserved by Wen Xiao.

## Instruction

The application framework is developed on Unity **2018.1.9f** for iOS and iPad 9"7 (2048 * 1536). 

### Part 1

The user will be able to scan 7 physical images. Each one will have a little 3D to display and to anchor above the picture (the 3D will be animated). Each picture will also trigger a persistent thread of messages like on Facebook Messenger. A bubble animation and the message will appear after a specific amount of time. This augmented reality part is implemented by Vuforia.

### Part 2

The second part is a two persistent buttons. If the user clicks on the first button he can see some options to be able to select which 3D he want to display between a heart, a hand, a head and an eye. Each 3D model is able to be rotated and zoomed in and out. The user can see some informations on the screen and can trigger some specific action on each 3D (ex:  cross-sectional view)

### Others

With the second button, the user can access to the references, see the terms of use and change dynamically the language. By default the language will load the corresponding user's system language or english. if the user change his language through this application, the system needs to save the preference to be able to use it when the application will ba start again.
